    name="Twitch Chat Sounds"
    description="Adds a command to Twitch Extended that causes a sound to be played when a chat message is received.
    To make it work, connect to your Twitch channel in Noita's streaming options, then go to Config Lib > Twitch Extended > Commands > Twitch Chat Sounds, enable the feature, and clear the 'Chat command' field.
    Comes with a small selection of sounds to choose from, pulled right from the game. Click 'Run Command' to preview the sounds."
